### Purpose
MediTrack is a medical health tracking mobile application. The user will get a chance to enter medications, appointments, and symptoms, and this application will keep a summary of all of the information. The Home tab will consist of shortcuts to the Calendar and Input pages, as well as current health related news that could be of interest to the user. The Calendar tab will hold information regarding appointments, medications, and refills. The Incident Summary tab will consist of line graphs that can help the user keep track of their symptoms.
